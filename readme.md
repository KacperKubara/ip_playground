# Setup and Installation
RDKit has been installed with a conda, because the package is not available via PyPI:
```
$ conda create -c rdkit -n my-rdkit-env rdkit
```
The virtual conda environment was used to isolate this amazing, well-built package which has a potential of destroying all of my global package dependencies :))
